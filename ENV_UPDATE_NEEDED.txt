ADD THIS LINE TO YOUR .env FILE:

ICYPEAS_USER_ID=e4aDpJsBimkh-TeQaV1A

That's it! The bulk email enrichment will then work properly.

If you don't have a .env file yet, create one in the project root with:

ICYPEAS_API_KEY=your_icypeas_api_key_here
ICYPEAS_USER_ID=e4aDpJsBimkh-TeQaV1A

(Plus any other API keys you're using)
